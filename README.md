Hey, I'm Branden van Staden, a Fullstack Software Engineer based in Cape Town, South Africa. At 24, born on October 22, 1999, I thrive on challenges and continually broaden my skills in EdTech, ML, Cloud Infrastructure, Data Sciences, Software Engineering, and Fullstack Development.

## About Me

My journey in the software development realm involves tackling challenges that push my boundaries. I'm always in learning mode, looking to expand my skill set. I strongly believe in giving back to the developer community. Teaching and sharing knowledge with beginner programmers is my way of contributing to the community's growth. I see learning as an ongoing journey, and my passion lies in programming and its related fields. Discovering joy in learning and passing on that knowledge to others reinforces and validates my own understanding.
